# Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users

## Project Intro

The purpose of this project was to create regression models, learn how to create useful features, predict prices for objects.


### Methods Used
* Data processing
* Data visualization
* Search for highly correlated variables
* Features engineering
* Finding the asymmetry of numerical features.
* Machine Learning
* Cross Validation
* Blending models by assigning weights

## Work Done Summary
* Learned a lot of useful tricks to help increase the result of the model
* Learned to visualize data and draw conclusions from graphs
* Learned to do cross-validation, make ensembles and give weights to models
* The model showed beautiful results (Top 1% on Kaggle)
